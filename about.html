            <h2>My name’s Emma, I’m a UX/UI designer and illustrator living in New Zealand.</h2>
            <p>I graduated in 2021 with a Diploma in Web & UX Design after studying at Yoobee College of Design. I have since been working as a freelance designer creating websites, logos, posters, and other graphic art.</p>

            <p>I’ve been drawing and making designs since I was a little kid. I’m passionate about art and technology and love being able to use my two passions together.</p>
                
            <p>I am currently looking for a role as a UX/UI designer with a focus on the frontend side. My longterm goal is to become a lead fullstack designer, and one day further study in the software engineering field.</p>
