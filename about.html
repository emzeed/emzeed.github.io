            <h2>My name’s Emma, I’m a UX/UI and graphic designer living in New Zealand.</h2>
            <p>I graduated in 2021 with a Diploma in Web & UX Design after studying at Yoobee College of Design. I have since been working as a freelance designer creating websites, logos, posters, and other graphic art.</p>

            <p>I’ve been drawing and making designs since I was a little kid. I’m passionate about art and technology and love being able to use my two passions together.</p>
                
            <p>I am currently looking for a role at a creative agency, as either a UX/UI designer or graphic designer. I am experienced in both design and web development meaning I can approach a project from a creative and technical point of view.
                My skills allow me to work on any project from a quick illustration on paper, to building an e-commerce store online.
