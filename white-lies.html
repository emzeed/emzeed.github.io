                <h1>WHITE LIES ENTERTAINMENT</h1>
                <p>White Lies Entertainment is an event planning and dj hiring business. For their upcoming event, Winter Bassdown they hired me to design and create a poster and banner to advertise the event.</p>

                <h3>The Goal</h3>
                <p>White Lies Entertainment wanted me to create a poster and a banner to advertise their upcoming event, Winter Bassdown. They gave me mostly creative freedom on the design, however it did have to follow their layout. I had a time frame of roughly two weeks.</p>

                <h3>Sketches</h3>
                <p>I started by researching other event posters, mostly for DNB and rock gigs. I also researched blue colour schemes and how other posters used a blue theme in their design. After researching, I sketched several ideas I had for the design.</p>

                <h3>Colour Scheme</h3>
                <p>I chose a blue theme because it conveyed the winter theme of the event. By using a highlighter blue against a dark blue I was able to create more contrast and depth with similar colours. The dark blue creates a night feeling, and the highlighter blue looks like neon lights which both reflected the event.</p>

                <h3>Title Design</h3>
                <p>For the title, I was inspired by slime text because it is very reminiscent of dark, and grungy design. To stay with the winter theme, I created a frozen text inspired by the dripping slime design.</p>

                <h3>Font Design</h3>
                <p> I used Frankling Gothic Medium for the font.</p>
                <p>For the header text I used a white fill and added the same text over top with no fill and a blue stroke to create the 3D effect that matched the title text.</p>
                <p>For the sub text, I used a white a blue gradient so that the act names stood out, and for the important information I used plain white text so that it was easy to read.</p>
