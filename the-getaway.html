                <h1>THE GETAWAY</h1>
                <p>The GetAway is a booking/accomodation app for a fictional resort called The GetAway. The app was created for my Web & UX Design Diploma.</p>
                
                <p>For this project, we were tasked to create a single page app using JavaScript that allowed users to book accomodation.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h3>The Goal</h3>
                <p>We had to create a single page app using Vanilla JavaScript. Users had to be able to book a date, a type of accomodation that was dependant on the number of guests, and food from a menu. The app also had to include a JavaScript widget.</p>

                <div>
                    <h4>The App</h4>
                    <p>I wanted the design to be very simple and straightforward to use because the target audience ranged from people who would be tech savy and those who weren’t. By creating an isolated section for each task, I felt users would find the app less overwhelming and confusing. </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Visual Design</h4>
                    <p>The fictional resort is a tree house accomodation service in the forests around New Zealand. I wanted the app to look very calm and nature-like to go with the theme of the resort.</p>

                <h3>Original Design</h3>
                <p>I used unsplash.com to find images for the app. I then based the colour scheme off of these images. Originally, the landing page was designed to have a carousel of sliding images to give the app more life.</p>
                <p>Because of time restraints, I didn’t develop the design much further. However, I have since updated the design which I have included at the end.</p>

                    <h4>Visual</h4>
                    <p>I went with the original design, adding some minor adjustments to work with the widget and functionality.
                        I chose black and white to go with the green because it was simple, and made the information easily readable against the background.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Functionality</h4>
                    <p>Each task for the user has it’s own page, and once the task is appropriatly completed, the user can move on to the next. The app is designed so that users can only book what is available to them.</p>

                <p>As a requirement for the project, only some accomodation types were available depending on the number of guests. 
                <br>In this app, accomodation was disabled until the user selected the number of people in their party. Afterwards, the available accomodation became inabled.

                <p>I added a calendar widget that allowed me to select start and end dates. Users were provided with the minimum and maximum number of nights available depending on their accomodation and then were able to select the dates. I added a ‘confirm dates’ button which checks that the number of nights selected is accurate, and if they are, then users can move forward.</p>
