                <p>For my Diploma in Web and UX Design, I was tasked to create a single page app using vanilla Javascript.

                <br>The GetAway is a fictional brand of tree house resorts in New Zealand.</p>

                <div>
                <h2>The Goal</h2>
                <p>The app needed to allow the users to choose from a selection of different priced accomodation, select a date and length of stay which had different requirements based on the accomodation, and select a meal. The app was also required to implement a widget. </p>

            <div class="text">
                <h2>Concept Design</h2>
                <p>I chose a simple forest green theme with black and white accents to match the nature theme. I used a familiar mobile layout to make the booking experience straight forward for the user.</p>

            <p class="small-text">The above image shows the accomodation and date selecting process. The user selects the number of people in their group which enables the accomodation that allows for that many guests. Once the accomodation is selected, the 'next' button is enabled.</p>
            <p class="small-text">When selecting dates, the user is given a minimum and maximum number of nights based off their chosen accomodation. The user confirms that the correct amount of nights has been selected before they can move forward.</p>

    <section class="four">

        <div class="img"></div>

        <p class="small-text">Users are shown the menu and can either decide to choose a meal for each guest or skip this. Users must choose a night for the dinner service and then can select a menu for each guest.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="five">

        <div class="img"></div>

        <p class="small-text">Users are shown the information of their booking and the overall cost. They are then directed to a payment form which is validated and cannot be confirmed without being correctly filled out.</p>
